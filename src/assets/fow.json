    "BIOGRAPHY": "Originally from England, Adelaide Still became Mrs. Eddy’s personal maid in 1907. She quickly proved herself <i>“true as steel and loyal as the most faithful, old or new,”</i> noted secretary William Rathvon. Earlier, the young woman had been a nanny for the children of a Harvard professor, and Longyear’s collection includes sweet letters Adelaide wrote to keep in touch with little Benjamin Pray, one of her charges.\n\nAfter Mrs. Eddy’s passing, Miss Still became one of the caretakers here and then continued to live in the Boston area. She was often asked to talk about her experiences in the household, and one of the things she always emphasized was Mrs. Eddy’s “steadfastness in giving this great Truth to the world.”",

The staff loved her jolly demeanor, and everyone appreciated her skills. Anna was adept at cleaning the exquisite glassware for which her native country was famed, and she could expertly launder lace, silk, velvet, and the like. Anna worked for Mrs. Eddy from 1905 to 1908 and then returned to Cedar Rapids, where she became a Christian Science practitioner.",

One day, Mrs. Eddy wondered aloud why the crackers she enjoyed eating with milk—a traditional New England light supper of yesteryear—didn’t taste the way she remembered. It was a small thing, but Lottie was eager to help. She and Frank tracked down a bakery in Montpelier that had been making crackers the same way for 100 years.

After being healed by Christian Science, she took a class with Mary Baker Eddy in Chicago and soon began healing others herself. Laura eventually became a teacher of Christian Science, and she and her sister Victoria were instrumental in establishing the religion in their home state.\nAsked to come East in 1890 to work for Mrs. Eddy, Laura responded promptly, earning her teacher’s gratitude. “What should I have done without your dear sister?” Mrs. Eddy wrote to Victoria. “She is the best, the kindest and dearest girl in all the world to me...”. A faithful student and metaphysical worker, Laura was also Mrs. Eddy’s devoted friend, as keenly attuned to her needs as a daughter throughout the two decades she spent at her side.",
