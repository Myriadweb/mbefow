    "BIOGRAPHY": "<p><span>O</span>riginally from England, Adelaide Still became Mrs. Eddy’s personal maid in 1907. She quickly proved herself “true as steel and loyal as the most faithful, old or new,” noted secretary William Rathvon. Earlier, the young woman had been a nanny for the children of a Harvard professor, and Longyear’s collection includes sweet letters Adelaide wrote to keep in touch with little Benjamin Pray, one of her charges.</p><p>After Mrs. Eddy’s passing, Miss Still became one of the caretakers here and then continued to live in the Boston area. She was often asked to talk about her experiences in the household, and one of the things she always emphasized was Mrs. Eddy’s “steadfastness in giving this great truth to the world.”</p>",

Tomlinson helped Mrs. Eddy as a secretary and metaphysical worker, first in Concord, New Hampshire, and again here. Although everyone in the household spent most waking hours working, he wrote, Mrs. Eddy “taught us that we should know and realize that one does not grow weary in doing good, when one truly knows what good is. ...”</p><p>A Christian Science practitioner and teacher, Irving gave the first lecture after Mrs. Eddy established the Board of Lectureship in 1898. He also served as President of The Mother Church.</p>",
